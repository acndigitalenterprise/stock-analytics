## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database
4. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
5. Seed admin user: `php artisan db:seed`
6. Start server: `php artisan serve`

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# OpenAI API Key (Required for AI Stock Advice)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional API Keys for better stock search results
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_key
YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY=your_yahoo_key
```

### OpenAI API Setup

1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. The AI advice feature requires this key to function

### Local Development

The application works without API keys using the local fallback data, but AI advice generation requires OpenAI API key.

## Usage

1. Visit `/stock-analytics`
2. Start typing a stock code (e.g., "GIHON", "NVDA", "AAPL")
3. Select from the auto-suggestions
4. Fill in other required fields
5. Submit your request

## Admin Access

- URL: `/stock-analytics/admin`
- Default admin: Check the AdminUserSeeder for credentials

```json
[
  {
    "code": "NVDA",
    "name": "NVIDIA Corporation",
    "type": "EQUITY",
    "region": "US"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

- Network timeouts: 5 seconds per API call
- Graceful degradation to local data
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

## Performance

- Debounced search prevents excessive API calls
- Caching can be implemented for frequently searched terms
- Local fallback ensures functionality even without internet
